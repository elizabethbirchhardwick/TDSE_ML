## 📘 What is this repository?

This repository contains the full code and analysis accompanying the project _Solving the Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation using Machine Learning_. The goal of this study is to use a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to learn the dynamics of quantum systems—specifically, the quantum harmonic oscillator.

The model is trained to solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) using only the physical laws governing the system and no explicit supervision. It achieves high accuracy in predicting both coherent and breathing state dynamics.
